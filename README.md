Title: Driver Gene Identification for Prostate Cancer Using an Integrative Probabilistic Graphical Model  
Authors: Raquel Aoki and Oliver Snow 
Type: Course Project  

Abstract:   
The availability of large-scale genomic data combined with
the recent success of targeted therapies has motivated researchers to characterize the genes that drive cancer progression. Despite strong efforts using both experimental and
computational approaches, uncovering true driver genes has
remained challenging. The most successful methods have integrated multiple sources of genomic data, combining several
weak signals to identify drivers. Here we present a probabilistic graphical model, which incorporates different types
of prostate cancer data into one score to discern driver genes
from passenger genes. Our final model finds 21 bona-fide
prostate cancer driver genes, demonstrating the flexibility of
this approach to be applied to different cancer types. Future
work would aim to improve the model to expand this list of
identified drivers in the hopes of finding novel drug targets.
